# NoSQL Database Studies

This repository contains my studies and experiments related to NoSQL databases. Currently, I am focused on MongoDB, but I plan to explore other NoSQL databases in the future, such as DynamoDB, SQL, and others.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to understand NoSQL database concepts, starting with MongoDB, and gradually learning about other types of NoSQL databases. I aim to explore their architectures, features, and practical use cases, comparing them with relational databases.

## Current Focus: MongoDB

At this stage, the primary focus is on MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database. I am studying:

- MongoDB setup and configuration
- Aggregation framework
- Indexing and performance optimization
- Real-world use cases

## Structure

The repository includes:

- **MongoDB Examples**: MongoDB queries and use cases.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Problems solved using MongoDB.
- **Future Additions**: Upcoming studies on other NoSQL databases (DynamoDB, SQL, etc.).

## How to Run

To get started with MongoDB examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wmsalves/no-sql-study.git
   cd no-sql-study
